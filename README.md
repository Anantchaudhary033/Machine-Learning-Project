-- Wine Quality Prediction --

The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to classify wine quality based on various chemical properties using logistic regression. This project leverages a dataset containing numerous attributes of wines to build a predictive model that can assess the quality of wine as 'Good' or 'Bad'. The primary objective of this project is to develop a logistic regression model that can accurately classify the quality of wine based on the aforementioned chemical properties. This classification helps wine producers and consumers in quality control and decision-making processes.
